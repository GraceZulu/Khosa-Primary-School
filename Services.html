    <h2>Our Curriculum</h2>
    <p>Khosa Primary School's learners enjoy an enriched curriculum whose breadth and depth assurance of acquiring appropriate knowledge, skills, and values. The academic program builds their confidence, independence,  love for learning, and ability to solve life’s challenges beyond their primary school years.

        All learners have opportunities to explore and realise their full potential in a learning community that challenges them to set high expectations and work to achieve them. A high premium is placed on every pupil’s pursuit of academic excellence. At the same time, a desire for lifelong learning is nurtured by a spirit of inquiry, critical thinking, and hands-on learning through collaborative student projects. Khosa Primary School's qualified teaching team works closely with each learner to provide appropriate support at each stage of their academic, physical, social, and emotional development.
